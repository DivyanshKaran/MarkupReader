# SkillSync Extension Functionality Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Service Worker Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The extension was using the simple service worker (`service-worker-simple.ts`) instead of the full-featured one (`service-worker.ts`) that includes ProfileManager integration.

**Solution**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to use the proper service worker:
```typescript
'background/service-worker': resolve(
  __dirname,
  'src/background/service-worker.ts'  // Changed from service-worker-simple.ts
),
```

### 2. UI Components Bypassing Service Worker
**Problem**: The popup and options pages were directly using ProfileManager services instead of communicating through the service worker message system.

**Solution**: 
- Created `ServiceWorkerClient.ts` to provide a clean interface for service worker communication
- Updated `ProfileEditor.tsx` to use service worker client instead of direct ProfileManager calls
- Updated `options.tsx` to use service worker client for all profile operations
- Updated `ProfileSelector.tsx` to use service worker client for profile management

### 3. Missing Service Worker Message Handlers
**Problem**: The simple service worker only handled basic messages (PING, GET_EXTENSION_INFO, HEALTH_CHECK) but lacked profile management handlers.

**Solution**: The full service worker now includes comprehensive message handlers:
- `PROFILE_CREATE` - Create new profiles
- `PROFILE_GET` - Retrieve specific profile
- `PROFILE_UPDATE` - Update existing profile
- `PROFILE_DELETE` - Delete profile
- `PROFILE_GET_ALL` - Get all profiles
- `PROFILE_GET_BY_EMAIL` - Find profile by email
- `PROFILE_SET_ACTIVE` - Set active profile
- `PROFILE_GET_ACTIVE` - Get active profile
- `PROFILE_SWITCH` - Switch to different profile
- `PROFILE_GET_STATS` - Get profile statistics
- `PROFILE_EXPORT` - Export profiles
- `PROFILE_IMPORT` - Import profiles

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Service Worker Client (`src/services/ServiceWorkerClient.ts`)
```typescript
export class ServiceWorkerClient {
  // Provides clean interface for service worker communication
  async createProfile(profileData: any): Promise<ServiceWorkerResponse>
  async getProfile(profileId: string): Promise<ServiceWorkerResponse>
  async updateProfile(profileId: string, profileData: any): Promise<ServiceWorkerResponse>
  // ... other profile management methods
}
```

### 2. Updated ProfileEditor Component
- Replaced direct ProfileManager calls with service worker client
- Proper error handling for service worker responses
- Maintains same UI functionality with proper backend integration

### 3. Updated Options Page
- All profile operations now go through service worker
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Maintains existing UI behavior

### 4. Updated ProfileSelector Component
- Profile loading and switching now uses service worker
- Proper error handling for communication failures
- Maintains existing UI behavior

## Testing the Extension

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder

### 2. Test Profile Creation
1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. Click "Create Profile" to open the options page
3. Fill in profile information and click "Save"
4. Verify the profile is saved and appears in the profile list

### 3. Test Profile Management
1. In the options page, verify you can:
   - Create new profiles
   - Edit existing profiles
   - Delete profiles
   - Set active profile
   - Switch between profiles

### 4. Test Service Worker Communication
1. Open the test page: `test-extension.html`
2. Test each functionality:
   - Ping test
   - Health check
   - Profile creation
   - Profile retrieval

## Expected Behavior

### Popup Functionality
- Profile selector should load and display available profiles
- "Create Profile" button should open options page
- Profile switching should work properly

### Options Page Functionality
- Profile list should load on page open
- "Create Profile" button should open profile editor
- Profile editor should save profiles successfully
- Profile deletion should work with confirmation
- Active profile setting should work

### Service Worker Functionality
- All profile operations should communicate through service worker
- Error handling should provide user-friendly feedback
- Profile data should persist between extension sessions

## Troubleshooting

### If profiles don't save:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify service worker is running (check `chrome://extensions/`)
3. Check if ProfileManager is properly initialized

### If popup doesn't load profiles:
1. Check if service worker client is working
2. Verify message passing between popup and service worker
3. Check for JavaScript errors in popup

### If options page doesn't work:
1. Check if ProfileEditor is using service worker client
2. Verify all profile operations go through service worker
3. Check for error messages in the UI

## Architecture Overview

```
Popup/Options UI
       ↓
ServiceWorkerClient
       ↓
Service Worker (Background)
       ↓
ProfileManager
       ↓
StorageService + IndexedDBService
```

The extension now properly follows the Chrome extension architecture with:
- UI components communicating through service worker
- Service worker handling all business logic
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Data persistence through storage services
